- **Data Extraction**: It extracts key information such as patient details, provider information, service codes, drug identification etc.
- **Validation**: The parser performs basic validation checks to ensure that the parsed data conforms to the expected structure and standards.
- **Input Format**: The parser can accept data in .txt or .837 formats, or it can accept a list of files all at once.
- **Output Format**: Extracted data can be outputted in CSV format.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the parser according to specific requirements, adding support for additional segments or refining parsing logic.
